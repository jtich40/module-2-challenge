# Module 2 Challenge Assignment

## Description

The purpose of this website is to serve as a porfolio showcasing all bootcamp coding projects to potential employers during the job search process. It was built using the html and css languages and featured different topics covered during class such as selectors, display and position properties, flex boxes, and more. The Resume button in the nav bar is a placeholder for the time being until I have an updated resume as I progress through the bootcamp.

## Usage

Below is a link to the deployed website and accompanying screenshots.
